<h4><a name = "intro" id = "intro">INTRODUCTION</a></h4>

<p>The two tracts reprinted here, as well as Swift’s <i>Proposal for
correcting, improving and ascertaining the English tongue</i>, which
occasioned them, may be viewed in the context of the many seventeenth-
and eighteenth-century suggestions for the formation of a British
Academy. They are in part a result of the founding of the French Academy
in 1635, although the feeling in England that language needed regulating
to prevent its corruption and decline was not purely derivative. By the
close of the seventeenth century an informed Englishman might have been
familiar with a series of native proposals, ranging from those <ins
class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">of Carew of Antony</ins>
and Edmund Bolton early in the century to that of Defoe at the close.
Among the familiar figures who urged the advantages of an Academy were
Evelyn, the Earl of Roscommon, and Dryden. Of these Dryden was
particularly vocal; but Evelyn’s suggestion, associated as it was with
the Royal Society, was rather more spectacular. In 1665 he set forth for
the Society’s Committee for Improving the Language an exhaustive
catalogue of the forces tending to the corruption of the English tongue.
Those, he declared, are “victories, plantations, frontiers, staples of
commerce, pedantry of schools, affectation of travellers, translations,
fancy and style of court, vernility and mincing of citizens, pulpits,
political remonstrances, theatres, shops, &amp;c.” There follows
Evelyn’s careful formulation of the problems facing those who would
refine the language and fix its standards.</p>

<p>This sense of the corruption of the language and of the urgent need
for regulation was communicated to the eighteenth century, in which a
number of powerful voices called for action. Early in the period Addison
advocated “something like an Academy that by the best Authorities and
Rules ... shall settle all Controversies between Grammar and Idiom”
(<i>The Spectator</i>, No. 135). He was followed by Swift, who in turn
was followed by such diverse
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
persons as Orator Henlay, the Earl of Orrery, and the Earl of
Chesterfield. Curiously, Johnson’s appears to be the only weighty voice
in opposition: “the edicts of an English Academy,” he insisted, “would
probably be read by many, only that they might be sure to disobey
them.”</p>

<p>But if the two tracts reprinted here may be viewed in this context,
they may also be seen from another vantage--as part of the
interminable wrangling in the period between Whigs and Tories, even over
a matter so apparently non-political as the founding of an Academy.
Since it was Swift’s “petty treatise on the English Language”--the
epithet is Johnson’s--which provoked these two replies, we must look
briefly at his handiwork. Swift was undoubtedly guilty of pride of
authorship with respect to his <i>Proposal</i>, which appeared on May
17, 1712, in the form of a <i>Letter to the Earl of Oxford</i>. He had
touched on the problem earlier in the <i>Tatler</i> (No. 230), but this
is a more considered effort. In June, 1711, he first broached to Harley
the idea of “a society or academy for correcting and settling our
language,” and with Harley’s approval he began to compose the
<i>Letter</i>. Yet it was eight months before the document reached
Harley and another two months, during which it circulated among friends,
before Swift retrieved it for the printer. Thus, and this fact has
significance, the <i>Proposal</i> had its inception and its first
consideration in the Tory circles attached to the Harley ministry.
A&nbsp;few days before its publication Swift wrote to Stella:
“I&nbsp;suffer my name to be put at the End of it, wch I nevr did before
in my Life.”</p>

<p>Now this willingness to publish under his own name also has a special
significance. It is not merely, as is often assumed, that he cherished
the project, though very likely that played a part. He was motivated,
I&nbsp;am convinced, by a desire to flaunt the <i>Proposal</i> as a
party document. It is true that he wrote to Stella two weeks after its
publication that “there are 2 Answers come out to it already, tho tis no
Politicks, but a harmless Proposall about the Improvement of the Engl.
Tongue.” “I&nbsp;believe,” he added, “If I writt an Essay upon Straw
some fool would answer it.” But this disclaimer is ingenuous in the
light of the political overtones in the
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>
<i>Proposal</i>; for example, the extended praise of Barley as one who
saved his country from ruin “by a foreign war and a domestic faction.”
In fact, the lengthy panegyric of the Lord Treasurer, as well as other
matter, is bluntly and deliberately partisan. It could not conceivably
have been interpreted otherwise by contemporaries; nor could Swift have
been unaware of its provocative impact upon his readers. Oldmixon
remarks ironically of this part the <i>Proposal</i>--and small wonder
that he does--that it is “incomparable, full of the most delicate
Eulogy In the World.” Furthermore Swift knew, in view of his position as
leading writer for the Tory ministry, that to sign his name was to
invite attack--even if he wrote, as he says, upon straw.</p>

<p>There is no doubt he thought the formation of an Academy a matter of
great importance. Why then did he deliberately introduce controversial
elements and thus make impossible a discussion of his proposal wholly on
its merits? I&nbsp;suggest as a possible answer that he wished the Whigs
to dissociate themselves from the project and that he used the tactics
expected to achieve this end, in the desire that entire credit for the
founding of the Academy should rest with Harley and Harley’s supporters.
The partisan approach was therefore shrewdly calculated to provoke
opposition and to avoid any leaven of Whiggism in the “institution and
patronage” of the Academy. Swift wanted the contemporary prestige, as
well as the favorable verdict of posterity, to be unmistakably placed.
Nevertheless there was no intention of excluding meritorious Whigs from
the original membership--only, as is clear from Swift’s attitude, from
the “institution and patronage” of the Academy. In a list of
Academicians drawn up by Swift and Harley, unhappily not extant, members
of both parties were included--so Swift wrote to Archbishop King in
Dublin, and there is no reason to doubt it. Even Oldmixon grudgingly
reports that Swift had promised “the Whigs that they shall come in if
they will.” However violent his partisanship at times, Swift could and
did respect merit; and Harley was always ready to placate individual
members of the Opposition. There is therefore no need to take seriously,
as Oldmixon and the authors of <i>The British Academy</i> pretend to do,
the list of potential members
<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
of the Academy printed first in the <i>Amsterdam Gazette</i> and quoted
in <i>The British Academy</i>. It will be seen at a glance that they
constitute that dinner group of Tory “Brothers,” the Society to which
Swift belonged, a&nbsp;group sufficient for its avowed purpose--“to
advance conversation and friendship, and to reward deserving persons” --
but of course he would not have accepted them <i>in toto</i> for the
Academy.</p>

<p>The Whig writers began their attack on the <i>Proposal</i>
immediately. In the <i>Medley</i>, founded by Mainwaring and Oldmixon
“to provide an Antidote against the Poison of the Examiner,” there is a
brief reference in the issue of May 19-23, 1712, to “the very
extraordinary Letter to a Great Man,” followed in the next issue by an
extended political attack with the <i>Proposal</i> as the point of
departure. Thus at the outset Swift’s pamphlet was treated as a party
document. At the same time the Whig writers were readying two pamphlets
in answer, both announced in the <i>Medley</i> of May 19-23 as soon to
be printed. Apparently neither of these appeared, at least not under the
announced titles; but by May 26 Oldmixon’s <i>Reflections</i> had been
published anonymously and was referred to in the <i>Medley</i> as “a
very ingenious Pamphlet.” As any reader of the <i>Reflections</i> will
observe for himself, the pamphlet opens on a violent political note and
sustains it throughout. Although Oldmixon is more concerned to level
charges against Swift--a&nbsp;lewd, irreverent cleric,
a&nbsp;turncoat, a&nbsp;party scribbler, etc.--than to deny the
validity of Swift’s views concerning the language, he does directly
challenge certain points. And he arrives at a conclusion which may well
have been the result of honest conviction rather than mere party
opposition: that it is neither desirable nor possible to fix the
language forever. In a sense this was the chief issue, and the one where
the authoritarian view as represented by Swift and others was most
vulnerable. Is it possible, by the edicts of an academy however eminent
its members and respected its authority, to negate or control the
principle of change inherent in language? Unfortunately Oldmixon did not
live long enough to see his attitude aggressively expounded by one of
greater stature who also
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
took issue with Swift, both in the <i>Preface to the Dictionary</i> and
in the life of Swift.</p>

<p><i>The British Academy</i>, published May 30, 1712 (advertised in the
<i>Spectator</i> of that date), is of composite authorship. The one
person known to have had a hand in it--“a&nbsp;great Hand,” says
Oldmixon--is Arthur Mainwaring (<i>The life and posthumous works of
Arthur Maynwaring, Esq.</i> [London, 1715], p.&nbsp;324; this is the
source of most of our knowledge of Mainwaring.). The identity of
Mainwaring’s collaborators is a matter of conjecture. Perhaps the most
eligible are those who assisted with the <i>Medley</i>, as Steele,
Anthony Henley, and White Kennett. Among other possibilities are such
active Whig writers as Thomas Burnet and George Duckett; and even
Oldmixon cannot be ruled out. Doubtless Mainwaring was the inspiring
spirit--of this as well as other attacks on the group surrounding
Harley. Poet, ardent Jacobite convert to Whiggism, member of the Kit Kat
Club, member of Parliament, and Auditor of the Imprest, Mainwaring had a
brief but full career. It included a part in the <i>Whig Examiner</i>
and chief responsibility for the <i>Medley</i>. In the course of his
political opposition he appears to have developed a genuine hatred of
Swift, to whom he always referred, if Oldmixon’s word can be trusted, as
“one of the wickedest Wretches alive.” By May, 1712, when <i>The British
Academy</i> was published, he was already ill of the disease which ended
in his death a few months later; but he seems to have retained his vigor
and his clear intelligence to the end. <i>The British Academy</i> is
shrewdly conceived to cast odium on Swift’s proposal for an Academy by
identifying its potential members as a Tory faction and the whole
project as merely a scheme to provide Harley with a set of pensioners
who would be obliged in gratitude “to revere his Virtue and his Memory.”
Whereas in the <i>Reflections</i> Swift is assaulted with hard obvious
blows, in <i>The British Academy</i> a more subtle intelligence is
evident: the attack is oblique and ironic, and a tone of Addisonian
urbanity is fairly well maintained. Nevertheless it is not as literature
that these two answers to Swift are to be judged. They are minor, though
interesting, documents in political warfare which cut athwart a
significant cultural controversy.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">T</span>HE Bold Manner of publishing the
<em>Letter</em> for <em>correcting, improving</em>, and <em>ascertaining
the</em> English <em>Tongue</em>, made me conclude there was something
very extraordinary in it, and more than any one could expect from
Persons that were never thought to trouble themselves much about
<em>Fine Language</em>. But upon dipping into it, I&nbsp;found there was
nothing worthy the Character the Author acquir’d by other Ingenious
Pieces in our Tongue, tho’ I confess, it was not so much for the Beauty
of his Style as for other Qualities, some of which a Divine need not
brag of.</p>

<p>’Tis probable, our late Correspondence with <em>France</em> put such
a Whim into some Folks Heads, and because they have an <em>Academy</em>
for the same Use at <em>Paris</em>, we forsooth must have one at
<em>London</em>. The Foreign News, which sometimes tells us more Truth
of our doings here than our own, has the very Names of the Members of
the <em>Academy</em> which the Doctor speaks of. I&nbsp;do not find that
it is come to any thing more yet than meeting over a Bottle once a Week,
and being Merry. At which Times People

is printed in the <em>Amsterdam</em> Gazette to have been only a dull

that of <em>Reformation</em> has made us <em>Godly</em>; and I wish it

upon this <em>Project</em> and the <em>Projectors</em>, the more I was
diffident of it, for the Reasons mention’d in the following Pages.</p>

<p>I know very well the Epistle has but a sorry Reputation, even with
the Writer’s own <em>Party</em>, that it is looked upon as a silly
superficial Performance, and to be design’d only for an Opportunity to
shew what a <em>Nack</em> he has at <em>Panegyrick</em>. Be that as it
will, after I had consider’d the Subject he writes more leisurely than I
was won’t to do, I&nbsp;was loth to lose those Considerations; and
having put ’em into this Form, I&nbsp;flatter’d my self the Publick
would not receive them ill; at least all those whom Faction and
Prejudice have not render’d Insensible of Truth and Reason, and to such,

<h4>Refining the <span class = "smallcaps">English Tongue</span>.</h4>

<p><span class = "firstletter">I</span> Should be guilty of the greatest
Folly in the World, if I should go about to give a Character of Persons
of whom I have no manner of Knowledge. To speak well or ill of ’em wou’d
be equally Ridiculous and Dangerous: For it must be all Invention, and I
might then abuse a Man both in my Praise and Dispraise. It is thus with
me with Respect to the Author of the Letter lately publish’d about our
Language, and to his Patron. I&nbsp;know neither of them, and if I say a
Word more than themselves, or the World have said of them, I&nbsp;must
have recourse to Fiction, which I cannot think of without abhorrence,
where Reputation is concern’d.</p>

<p>That good old Church Martyr the Earl of <i>Strafford</i> was of
Opinion, <i>Common Fame</i> was enough to hang a Man, as in the Case of
the Duke of <i>Buckingham</i>, when he was impeach’d by the Commons for
Male Practices in his Ministry; and there were no
<span class = "pagenum">2</span>
better Grounds for accusing him, than that every Body said so. I&nbsp;am
quite of another Mind, and let the World say what they will of any one,
I&nbsp;am for condemning no body but whom the Law Condemns, and
therefore in these Reflections I shall not consider so much how to
please the Spleen of one Party, as how to expose the Arrogance of
another, who would lord it over us in every Thing, and not only force
their Principles upon us, but their Language, wherein they endeavour to
ape their good Friends the <i>French</i>, who for these three or
fourscore Years have been attempting to make their Tongue as Imperious
as their Power.</p>

<p>This most Ingenious Writer has so great a Value for his own Judgment
in Matters of Stile, that he has put his Name to his Letter, and a Name
greater than his own, as if he meant to Bully us into his Methods for
pinning down our Language and making it as Criminal to admit Foreign
Words as Foreign Trades, tho’ our Tongue may be enrich’d by the one, as
much as our Traffick by the other.

in College Learning, should
<span class = "pagenum">3</span>

in Compliment to a certain Lady, whose Breeding and Conversation must
have given her wonderful Opportunities to refine our Tongue, imagine,
that the Two Universities would give up so Essential a Branch of their
Privileges to the Ladies, and take from them the Standard of
<i>English</i>. This puts me in mind of <i>Fontenelle</i>’s way of
Learning a Language, which he recommends to be by having an Intrigue
with some Fair Foreigner; and beginning with the Verb <i>I Love, You
Love</i>, &amp;c. It is well enough from Him, a&nbsp;<i>Papist</i>, or
<i>Layman</i>, but for a Protestant Divine to erect an Academy of Women
to improve our Stile, is very extraordinary and gallant, and little
agrees with the cruel Quotation of the Author of <i>the Tale of a
Tub</i>, p.&nbsp;163.</p>

came from the Pen of a Reverend Doctor, who has sollicited lately for a

would adorn with some more such graces of Speech; as,

any Man to match in any Language, Dead or Living, <i>Pagan</i> or
<i>Christian</i>; and yet this is the Eloquence, as is pretended, of a
sound Orthodox Divine; one of the Champions of our <ins class =
"correction" title = "u invisible">Church</ins>, and the design’d
Chairman of a new Academy to reform and improve our Stile. I&nbsp;shall
only add here another
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
Flower in p.&nbsp;101. <i>If you fail hereof G<span class =
"dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span> damn you and yours to all Eternity</i>,
says the same Reverend Author, whose Works on some other Occasion I
shall examine, as to their Divinity, Piety, and other Merit, that the
World may see on what Foot that Author has establish’d his Fame, and how
judiciously a Man of his Cloth made himself first known to the World.
Whether the late <i>Examiner</i>, the <i>Miscellanies in Prose and
Verse</i> publish’d by <i>Morphew</i>, and some more such Political and
Pious Productions, did not come from the same Hand, I&nbsp;shall not
determine. They are generally said to be written by the same Person, and
how nearly related that Person is to our Letter Writer, is as well known
as that he is a Doctor of Divinity, and hopes to make his Fortune by
Preferments in that Church of which he is so bright an Ornament, as
appears by what has been already quoted; by which one may perceive, how
well qualify’d he is to form Schemes, for the <i>refining of our
Tongue</i>, and the <i>Advancement of Religion</i>; of both which he has
written. The latter does not come under Consideration so naturally in
this Discourse as it will in another, and therefore it shall be deferr’d
till such an Opportunity offers. Perhaps Our Elegant Writer will pretend
to justify these Innovations in our Speech, for which the best Critick
upon him would be my Lord Chief Justice, by the Example of our Modern
Poets, and the Oaths and Curies of the Stage, where I never heard any
thing so
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
very Lewd, in Defyance of our Religion, Laws, and whatever is held
Sacred by Christians, and Protestants. If he had a hand in the
<i>Conduct of the Allies</i>, the <i>Remarks</i>, and other such
Factious Papers, as is reported, and he never once thought fit to
disown, being more Proud of the Honour done him in it, than asham’d of
the Falshood and Scandal of those Libels, it is no strange Matter that a
Man of such a Conscience should do or write any Thing; Cursing and
Swearing being not so bad as the Robberies that Libeller has committed
on the good Name of the best and greatest Men of this Age and
Nation.</p>

<p>The merriest part of the Project he has been hatching, for an
<i>English</i> Academy to bring our Tongue to his pitch of Perfection,
is that he has assign’d, that Task to the <i>Tories</i>, whose Wit have
so distinguish’d them in all Times. If there had ever been a Man among
’em who had a right Notion of Letters or Language, who had any relish of
Politeness, it had been something. But as there never was one, unless it
were two or three Apostate Whigs who had been bred up by the Charity of
those Friends they deserted, that had any smattering of Learning, except
in Pedantry, nor Tast of any Books but <i>Eikon Basilike</i>, and the
<i>Thirtieth</i> of <i>January</i> Sermons; ’tis amazing that he shou’d
be so foolish as to fancy, that Learning which always goes by the Stile
of Common-wealth, would submit to the Arbitary Government of an
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
Ignorant and Tyrannical Faction. Nor is it at all strange, that those,
who by their Practices and Principles, have for above Fourscore Years
been doing their utmost to Enslave us, shou’d always have a Contempt for
Wit and Eloquence, which ever have been the Friends of Reason and
Liberty.</p>

<p>Whoever reads the Thirty Fifth Chapter of <i>Longinus</i> will find,
that ’tis impossible for a Tory to succeed in Eloquence, and that if
they cannot impose so far on Men’s Understandings, as to make Fustian
pass for Oratory, their Project of an Academy, will be as Chimerical as
if they shou’d flatter us with a Trade and Settlements in the Moon. The
Reader will not be displeas’d, to see what the Ancients thought of the
Capacity of Men of such Principles in Matters of Eloquence, and let a
long Experience among us, prove the right Judgment the
<i>Philosopher</i> in <i>Longinus</i> made of them 1500 Years ago. He is
treating of the <i>Causes of the Decay of Humane Wit</i>; <i>I can never
enough admire</i>, said he, <i>how it came to pass, that there are so
many Orators in our Times, and so few of ’em rise very high in the
Sublime; so Steril are our Wits now a Days; is it not</i>, continues he,
<i>because what is generally said of Free Governments, that they nourish
and form great Genius’s is true? especially, since almost all the Famous
Orators that ever flourish’d and liv’d died with them? Indeed, can there
be anything that raises the Souls of Great Men more than Liberty; any
thing which can more powerfully excite and awaken in us that
<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
Sentiment of Nature which provokes us to Emulation, and the glorious
desire of seeing our selves advanc’d above others? Add to this, that the
Rewards propos’d in such Governments, whet and perfectly Polish the
Orators Wit and make ’em cultivate the Talents Nature has given them;
insomuch, that we see the Liberty of their Country shine in their
Orations.</i> He goes on, <i>but as for us, who were early taught to
endure the Yoke of Domination, and have been, as it were, wrapt up in
the Customs and Ways of Arbitrary Rule; who in a Word, never tasted that
living and Flowing Spring of Eloquence and Liberty; we commonly, instead
of Orators, become pompous Flatterers, for which reason, I&nbsp;believe
a Man Born in Servitude, may be capable of other Sciencies, but no Slave
can ever be an Orator, since when the Mind is depress’d and broken by
Slavery, it will never dare to think, or say any thing bold. All its
Vigour evaporates of it self, and it remains always as in Bonds; in
short, to make use of <em>Homer</em>’s Expression.</i></p>

<p>It is observable, that <i>Boileau</i> has no manner of remark on all
this Passage; it wou’d not have agreed with his Pension, from his Master
the <i>French</i> King, to have said a Word in praise of it, nor with
his Conscience to have condemn’d it; but <i>Dacier</i>, who had a
<i>Hugonot</i> Education, observes speaking of Liberty, shining in the
Orations of Orators living in Free States, that as those
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
<span class = "folionum">C</span>
<i>Men are their own Masters, their Mind us’d to this Independence,
produces nothing but what has the Marks of that Liberty, which is the

<p class = "space">
Now what a Friend the Letter writer, is to Liberty, we may see in the
<i>Examiner</i> of the 26th of <i>April</i>, 1711<ins class =
"correction" title = ". for ,">,&nbsp;</ins>which, tho’, it may be he
did not Write himself, whatever some People say to the contrary, he and
his Party have sufficiently own’d to make them accountable for every
Word in that and the rest of them. The reason why <i>Publick Injuries
are so seldom <span class = "correction">redress’d</span> is for want of
Arbitrary Power</i>, he calls it <i>Discretionary</i>; ’tis true, and if
I have wrong’d him, by putting Arbitrary in its Place; I&nbsp;ask his
Pardon.&mdash;</p>

<p class = "space">
Having said thus much of his Party in general, I&nbsp;might descend to
Particulars, and examine the sufficiency of the Characters of his
Academicians, a&nbsp;List of them being handed up and down, in which the
Author is not forgot. It is set off with Names that must not be
repeated, and amongst the rest are a Doctor or two, two or three Poets
and Tell Tales, and that Learned and Facetious Person Mr. <i>D<span
class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>ny</i>, whose very Name gives
unspeakeable Hopes of the Progress of such a Society, in refining our
Language, which he and most of his Brethren are so great Masters of,
that if twenty of the List will oblige us with as many Lines of Common
Sense and Common Grammar, I&nbsp;will be bound to read every thing that
shall be publish’d by this
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
Famous Academy, that is to be or under their Auspices, tho’ I had much
rather change that Pennance for <i>Ogilby</i> and <i>Blome</i>. To give
us the better <i>Idea</i> of his <i>Scheme, he has consulted with very
Judicious Persons</i>; we may judge of what truth there is in his
<i>Panegyricks</i>, by that of the deceas’d <i>Examiner</i> on himself;
where he says, <i>he had written with so much Reputation, and so much to
the Confusion of the Whigs, that they themselves have a Value for his
Person and Abilities, tho they have an Aversion to his Cause</i>. Of the
same size, I&nbsp;doubt not, are the able and judicious Persons he has
consulted about his Design, which must be own’d to be very good in it
self, and capable of such Improvement as wou’d make it one of the
Glories of Her Majesty’s most Glorious Reign. But alas, he will never
have the Honour of it. A&nbsp;Noble Lord, on whom he has written
<i>Libels</i> and <i>Encomiums</i>, was the first that thought of such a
thing, and <ins class = "correction" title = "text has ‘some-’ at line-end">some</ins> Years since nam’d forty Gentlemen to be Members of
an Academy, on a Foundation refining on the <i>French</i> of which
Number I am very well <span class = "correction">satisfy’d,</span> not a
Man of his most Illustrious Band wou’d ever have been, and that tho’ he
is so generous as to promise the Whigs that they shall come in if they
will, he must look ’em out better Company, or his Academy will have the
Glory <ins class = "correction" title = "‘o’ invisible">of</ins> this
great Work to themselves. Indeed the way is prepar’d for them to
<i>Immortality</i>, two <i>English</i> Grammars having been publish’d
within this Twelvemonth, and it remains to him and his Fraternity, to
add a <i>Dictionary</i> worthy those Immortal
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
<span class = "folionum">C2</span>
Labours; for which, there are not a Set of Men in <i>England</i> better
qualify’d, and so equal to so honourable a Task.</p>

<p>One wou’d think, that towards advancing this Scheme, all the
<i>Literati</i> of this Kingdom had sent their Powers to Him. That all
the Whigs as well as Tories had entrusted him with their Proxies; for he
says <i>I do here in the Name of all the Learned and Polite Persons of
the Nation complain, &amp;c.</i> Whereas whatever has been brag’d by him
in other Papers of the Nine in Ten, being on his side for the Land and
Church Interest, not nine in a thousand will trust him with that of Wit.
And I do here in the Name of all the Whigs, protest against all and
every thing done or to be done in it, by him or in his Name; being a
Person with whom they will have no manner of Dealings, as he very well
knows, or they might now have had him Scribbling for them as well as
when that Discourse was written <i>of the Contests and Dissentions of
the Nobles and Commons in <em>Athens</em> and <em>Rome</em></i>, wherein
it is said, <i>’tis agreed, that in all Governments there is an absolute
unlimited Power which naturally and originally seems <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘to to’">to</ins> be plac’d in the
People <em>in the whole Body</em>; wherever the Executive part lies</i>;
again, <i>this unlimited Power plac’d fundamentally in the Body of a
People, &amp;c.</i> and that he wrote better then than he has done since
is not to be wonder’d at, if there is any truth in what
<i>Longinus</i>’s Philosopher says.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
<p>It would be a poor Triumph to convict him of an Error in History 1700
Years ago, where he tells us, That <i>Cæsar</i> never attempted this
Island; <i>no Conquest was ever attempted till the Time of
<em>Claudius</em></i>, since I do not find that he or his Brethren have
any Notion at all that Truth is necessary in History: For they deny what
was done Yesterday, as frankly as if it had been in <i>Julius
Cæsar</i>’s Time; yet he himself has been sometimes forc’d to confess
the Power of Truth, and pay Allegiance to it; as where he says, the
great Reason of the Corruption of the <i>Roman</i> Tongue <i>was the
changing their Government into Tyranny, which ruined the Study of
Eloquence</i>; and because the <i>Whigs</i> shall have a Share in it, he
adds, and their calling in the <i>Palatines, their giving several Towns
in <em>Germany</em> the Freedom of the City</i>. A&nbsp;very pleasant
Reason that; for when the <i>Roman</i> Language was in the height of its
Purity in the <i>Augustan</i> Age, the Cities of <i>Asia</i> and
<i>Africk</i> were admitted to that Privilege, as much as the
<i>Europeans</i> were afterwards; and yet it cannot be pretended the
<i>Moors</i> were naturally more Polite than the <i>Germans</i>. It is
plain therefore this was a Party Stroke in favour of the
<i>Naturalization</i> Act, to shew what Inconveniences it hinders by
preventing Foreigners coming among us to debauch our Stile, as may be
seen by the prodigious Number of <i>Dutch</i> Words that
K.&nbsp;<i>William</i> brought with him into <i>England</i>.</p>

<p>Another Instance of the forc’d Homage he pays to Truth, is his
blaming <i>the Slavish
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
Disposition of the Senate and People of <em>Rome</em>, by which the
Eloquence of the Age was wholly turn’d into Panegyrick</i>. Now
considering how many Pages he has prodigally bestow’d upon it, in the
very Letter I am taking cognizance of is it not very odd he should call
Panegyrick <i>a Slavish Disposition</i>, and worse still that he should
term it the <i>most barren of all Subjects</i>; what if I could prove,
that above half of his Three Sheets of Paper are of that kind of
Panegyrick, which is so fatal to great Men. The <i>Greeks</i> said,
<i>Flatterers were like so many Ravens croaking about them, and that
they never lifted a Man up but as the <em>Eagle</em> does the
<em>Tortoise</em>, in order to get something by the fall of him.</i></p>

<p>It is a sad Case, when Men get a habit of saying what they please,
not caring whether True or False: Who can without pity see our Letter
Writer accuse the Famous <i>La Bruyere</i>, for being accessary to the
declining of the <i>French</i> Tongue, by his Affectation; when it is
notorious, that <i>La Bruyere</i> is the most masterly Writer of that
Nation, and that his Affectation was in the Turn of his Thought, which
he did to strike his Readers, who had been too much us’d to dry Lessons
to receive any Impression by them. He says, he has many Hundred <i>New
Words, not to be found in the Common Dictionaries before his Time</i>.
I&nbsp;should be glad to know, who are those Lexicographers, whose
Knowledge in the <i>French</i> Tongue he prefers to <i>La Bruyere</i>’s;
since <i>Richelet</i> and the <i>Academy</i> are not of his Æra,
I&nbsp;should rejoyce with him, if a way
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
could be found out to <i>fix our Language for ever</i>, that like the
<i>Spanish</i> Cloak, it might always be in Fashion; but I hope he will
come into Temper with the Inconstancy of Peoples Minds, of which he
complains, and that we are in no Fear of the Invasion and Conquest he
talks of, comforting himself, <i>that the best Writings may be preserved
and esteem’d</i>, meaning his own and his Friends, which no doubt would
fare much better than Mr. <i>Locks</i> or Mr. <i>Hoadly</i>’s; for
Conquerors are not us’d to take much Care of those that write against
them.</p>

<p>I like extreamly his rejecting the Old Cant of <i>Forty One</i>, and
giving the <i>great Rebellion</i> its true Name <i>Forty Two</i>: But,
if I had been he, I&nbsp;would not have named it at all. For there are a
great many Men in <i>England</i>, who, tho’ they were not concern’d in
it themselves, yet they do not love to hear of it, for the sake of those
that were; and it certainly was an Error in delicacy to touch upon so
tender a Part, no Man of Honour caring to have his Father and
Grandfather call’d Rogue and Rebel to his Face, especially if such
Grandfather or Father had no other Fault in the World but his Rebellion;
which after so many Acts of Oblivion, and a Revolution besides, can not
be a Crime of that Nature, as to last to the 3d and 4th Generation. He
is much to be commended however for his Impartiality, and pleading
Guilty to the Charge of the <i>Whigs</i>, that the <i>Licentiousness</i>
which enter’d with the <i>Rystauration</i>, infected our Religion and
Morals.
<span class = "pagenum">15</span>
How it corrupted our Language I can’t imagine, when the greatest Master
of it Arch-Bishop <i>Tillotson</i>, flourish’d all that Time; but I find
he is more conversant in the Court Poetry and the Plays, than the other
elegant Writings of those Times: Be it as it will, he would lay an
Infinite Obligation upon us, if he would recommend us to any Author in
the Reign of King <i>Charles</i> the Martyr, which he distinguishes as
the Golden Age of Politeness; who wrote with the Purity of
<i>Dryden</i>, <i>Otway</i>, and <i>Etheridge</i>, and with less
Affectation, which in Comick Writings is unavoidable, and in the best
never us’d but to be expos’d. Yet the <i>Poets</i> he affirms have
<i>contributed very much to the spoiling the Tongue</i>: And who would
he have to restore it? Himself, and his Brethren. Himself a Poet of
Renown, and who, if he would once speak his Mind, I&nbsp;make no
question is Prouder of his <i>Elegy upon Patridge</i>, and his Sonnet on
Miss <i>Biddy Floyd</i>, than of all His Prose Compositions together, or
even that elegant Poem, call’d <i>The Humble Petition of <em>Frances
Harris</em></i>, which is the Pink of Simplicity.</p>

well. I&nbsp;cannot help taking notice, that the Clamour he raises about
the Poets of King <i>Charles</i> the Second’s Reign, the only Age of
Poetry in <i>England</i>, is for their Contractions and leaving out the
<i>Eds</i> and <i>Eths</i>, wherein he offends intollerably in this very
Dogrel of his. Who wou’d have said <i>Smock unript and down it

waggery in it much better than any <i>Hudibrastick</i>; for it wou’d

<p>It will be no Authority with him, that Mr. <i>Dryden</i> commonly
contracted the Syllables that end <i>in Ed or Eth</i>. He was

a Poet, and tho’ certainly in most cases the sound is sweetned by it,
yet it offends those who are not for losing a Letter, and were they
<i>Frenchmen</i>, would doubtless be for pronouncing every one of them,
as well as Writing, to the great strengthning of that Enervate Tongue,
which languishes in reading for want of the <i><span class =

Pronounciation. A&nbsp;great Lord, and one who wou’d be worthy of a
Place, which is deny’d him in this Academy, having written against my
Lord <i>Rochester</i> in an <i>Essay upon Poetry</i>, Mr.
<i>Wolseley</i>, attacks the <i>Essayer</i> in a Preface written on

<p>Which may very well be introduc’d as often as one has occasion to
speak of the late <i>Examiner</i>, or any one that belongs to him. Let
this Learned Doctor and his new Academy do their utmost to furnish our
Language with what the <i>French</i> call <i>Chevilles</i>, with his
<i>Thoroughs</i>, <i>Althoughs</i>, and the whole Army of antiquated
Words before-mention’d; I&nbsp;can’t imagine Mr. <i>Dryden</i>’s Poetry
will be in any Danger of becoming unintelligible, tho’ he has us’d
Abreviations as much as any Polite Writer; and will preserve that
Character when the Doctor’s is forgotten, unless we should return to our
Original Barbarity, as he says we incline to do. He complains the
Refinement of our Language has hitherto been trusted to <i>illiterate
Court Fops, Half-witted Poets, and University Boys</i>. He would have
<span class = "pagenum">21</span>
a thin Society, if he should exclude all such from his own Academy: And
if the Choice be in himself, as he seems to insinuate, I&nbsp;believe
the Reformation of our Language would have just as much success as the
Reformation of our Manners, which, ’tis said, none have more corrupted
than the very Reformers. He gives us his Word, That <i>the Style of some
great Ministers very much exceed that of any other Productions</i>.
Where I wonder are the Instances of this Excellence? In Speeches in
Parliament, for themselves or others, or what Works of <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘theris’">theirs</ins> has been
communicated to him, that he should know more than all Mankind? One
would think he was their Master by what he says, in the next Page,
<i>What I have most at Heart, is some Method for ascertaining and fixing
our Language for ever.</i> Now you must know, that this Reverend Author,
who is so concern’d for the Fixing our Language, has himself a Style of
a very deficient Character; in which the Reader will perceive how much
we shou’d be <i>improv’d</i>, by having his manner <i>ascertained and
fixed</i>; for doubtless he thinks his own the best, and his Friends
know no better than to be of his Mind. <i>He would be more
comprehensive</i>, says an Author of Note, <i>if he would alter and
correct his Style, which is too loose and diffus’d in all Conscience. So
that when I read him sometimes for a good while together, tho’ I go on
very evenly and smoothly, I&nbsp;find it difficult to recollect what I
have been doing, and whether I have been reading or sleeping. My present
Advice to him therefore is, that he would study
<span class = "pagenum">22</span>
<em>Tacitus</em>, and such other Politicians as say much in few Words:
And if he obstinately persists in the same Childish fondness for his
Style, I&nbsp;shall be obliged to shew in how small a Compass the whole
Substance of what he says, may be contained. All this vile Drudgery will
I submit to for his sake</i>, &amp;c. But so little likelihood there is
of his mending his Style by reading <i>Tacitus</i>, that he defies him
and charges him with the Corruption of the <i>Roman</i> Tongue, by
saying that in Two or Three Words, about which such a Genius as he is
might have employ’d Twenty or Thirty. This Brevity he calls Affectation,
and assures us, it brought Barbarisms into the <i>Latin</i> Tongue, even
before the <i>Goths</i> invaded <i>Italy</i>. However he exposes his own
Ignorance, he should have been careful not to have discover’d his
Friends: Does the <i>Translation</i> of the <i>Bible</i> teach us to
understand <i>Fairfax</i>? Are that and the <i>Common-Prayer</i> the
Standard of Language? Yet he affirms, that without them one cou’d not
understand any thing written a hundred Years ago. Whereas the
<i>Jerusalem</i> of <i>Fairfax</i> is older than that, and whoever reads
it will find the Language as new as any can be expected from the New
Academy these Fifty Years. For our Tongue is not so variable in the best
Authors as the Doctor represents it, and the difference between the
present <i>English</i> and the <i>English</i> a Hundred Years ago, is
not so great as between the Old and Modern <i>French</i> in that Term.
Of all the Parts of Learning, that is surely the least ally’d to
Politeness
<span class = "pagenum">23</span>
that deals in Old Musty Manuscripts, and affects a Knowledge in Tongues
which have not one Polite Book to recommend them. How such a Quality can
be serviceable to the Advancement of Wit and <i>Eloquence</i>,
I&nbsp;cannot conceive; but there are some Characters in the World, that
encroach upon all others, and some Men that for their Interest will say
any thing that comes uppermost, either for or against another. The
Knowledge of Tongues is certainly very useful; but if a Person knows a
great many Ancient and Modern, and can hardly speak intelligibly in his
own, He shou’d be no Orator for me. I&nbsp;would no more value his
Learning than Sir <i>Hudibras</i>’s, of which the Doctor puts me in mind
more than once by his Compliments, especially of this Passage in the
first Canto.</p>

<div class = "verse ital">
<p>We grant, altho’ he had much Wit,</p>
<p>He was very shy of using it,</p>
<p>As being loth to wear it out.</p>
<p>And therefore bore it not about,</p>
<p>Unless on Holydays or so,</p>
<p>As Men their best Apparel do.</p>
<p>Besides, ’tis known he could speak <em>Greek</em></p>
<p>As naturally as Pigs <ins class = "correction" title = "punctuation unchanged">squeak.:</ins></p>
<p>That <em>Latin</em> was no more difficile</p>
<p>Than to a Blackbird ’tis to whistle;</p>
<p>Being rich in both he never scanted</p>
<p>His Bounty unto such as wanted;</p>
<p>But much of either wou’d afford,</p>
<p>To many that had not one Word:</p>
<p>For <em>Hebrew</em> Roots altho they’re found</p>
<p>To flourish but in barren Ground,</p>
<span class = "pagenum">24</span>
<p>He had such Plenty as suffic’d</p>
<p>To make some think him circumcis’d.</p>
</div>

<p>The rest of Sir <i>Hudibras</i>’s Merit in Letters is of a Piece, and
set off with a Puritanical Air, that renders the whole truly Ridiculous,
and makes a good Comment on several Pages of the Doctor’s Epistle, which
is most valuable for the great Judgment and Sincerity that he has shewn
in&nbsp;it.</p>

<p>It has already been observ’d, that <i>Horace</i> asserts <i><ins
class = "correction" title = "text unchanged">Osse</ins></i> to be the
only Rule of Language; and the Letter-Writer repeats what he says, <i>of
Words going off and perishing like Leaves, and new ones coming in their
Places</i>,<a class = "tag" name = "endtagC" id = "endtagC" href =
"#endnoteB">C</a> which he tells us <ins class = "correction" title =
"text unchanged">did not approve of <i>Horace</i></ins>, notwithstanding
his own Law of paying Obedience to usage. For if that were necessary,
what, according to our Author, would become of his <i>Monumentum Ære
<ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘pereunius’">perennius</ins></i>? Did not the <i>Roman</i> Tongue even
by his own confession, change as much as ours has done. <i>The Latin
Three Hundred Years before Tully was as <ins class = "correction" title
= "text reads ‘unintelligable’">unintelligible</ins> in his Time as the
<em>English</em> and <em>French</em> of the same Period are now.</i> And
the Corruptions afterwards by the <i>Barbarians</i> made it as different
from <i>Cicero</i>’s as <i>Ennius</i>’s; yet amidst all those
variations, <i>Horace</i>’s Works <ins class = "correction" title =
"text reads ‘ere’">are</ins> still <i>Monumentum ære perennius</i>. When
a Tongue is come to any degree of Perfection, whoever writes well in it
will Live; <ins class = "correction" title = "text reads ‘ther’es’">there’s</ins> a Thirst after Wit in all Ages, and those that

<i>Chaucer</i> will, no doubt, be admir’d as long as the <i>English</i>
Tongue has a Being; and the Changes that have happen’d to our Language
have not hinder’d his Works out living their Contemporary Monuments of
Brass or Marble.</p>

<p>The Doctor may as well set up a Society to find out the <i>Grand
Elixir</i>, the <i>Perpetual Motion</i>, the <i>Longitude</i>, and other
such Discoveries, as to fix our Language beyond their own Times. The
Test of their Successors will vary with the Age, and their Rules grow
obsolete as well as their Words. He would make us believe, that the
<i>French</i> Academy have not been able to preserve their Language from
Decay, and who are the Men in <i>Britain</i> who pretend to greater
Genius for Eloquence than the most Polite of the Politest Nation in
<i>Europe</i>. Mr. <i>Waller</i> Elegantly complains of the Change which
necessarily happens to Stile, and does it however in Language which
shews, that the Doctor need not be afraid of People’s forgetting his
Patron a Hundred Years hence, if he can write as good <i>English</i>
upon him now, as Mr. <i>Waller</i> did on this Subject Threescore Years
ago.</p>

</div>

<p>Our Author sees <i>no necessity of this Changing our Language</i>.
What has been the Fate of all Tongues Ancient and Modern, and for the
same Reasons will Eternally be so, he wou’d defend ours from, because
the Chinese <i>have Books in their Tongue above 2000 Years Old</i>; And
a History of 30000 Years Period with a Succession of Kings, 20000 Years
before <i>Adam</i>. It wou’d be a Discovery worthy those Men who have
lately been reconciling Contradictions, and building Arguments upon
Nonsence, to find out that <i>certain Standard for our Tongue, to which,
if it were refin’d</i>, he assures us, <i>it might be fixt for Ever</i>.
This wou’d be doing what was never done before, what neither
<i>Roman</i> nor <i>Greek</i>, which lasted the longest of any in its
Purity, could pretend to. And this would not be the only strange thing
that has lately happen’d to us, which never happen’d to a Nation before.
It will be in vain to pretend to <i>ascertain</i> Language, unless they
had the Secret of setting Rules for Thinking, and
<span class = "pagenum">27</span>
<span class = "folionum">[E2]</span>
could bring Thought to a Standard too. For every Age, as well as every
Nation, has its different manner of Thinking, of which the Expression
and Words will always have a Relish, and be Barbarous or Polite,
according as the Times take their Turn. If from the abundance of good
Sense which appears lately in every thing we do, The Doctor can
demonstrate, that we never were in a better way towards the Perfection
of Thought and Language, let him set about his Academy as soon as he
pleases. But if the contrary is apparent, it may not be improper to wait
for some more propitious Opportunity. Besides, there will in all times
be irregular Genius’s, who out of Humour will prefer Affectation to
Nature, and mistake Novelty for Beauty. <i>Boileau</i> in his
Reflections upon <i>Longinus</i>, has several Observations of this kind,
which will shew the difference between true and false Judgment, by
comparing what he writes with several Passages in the Doctor’s Letter;
he is speaking of the Famous <i>Ronsard</i> and his Imitators,
<i>Du-Bellai</i>, <i>Du Bartas</i>, <i>Desportes</i>, and other
<i>French</i> Poets in the Reigns of <i>Henry</i> III. and IV. who were
in great Fame for a long while, and when he wrote, sunk into the last
Contempt. <i>The same among the <em>Romans</em></i>, says he, <i>was the
Fate of <em>Nævius</em>, <em>Livius</em>, and <em>Ennius</em>,</i></p>

<p class = "inset">
who in <i>Horace</i>’s time had a great many Admirers as that Poet
informs us, but at last they were entirely decry’d. And it must not be
imagin’d that the Fall of these Authors,
<span class = "pagenum">28</span>
as well <i>French</i> as <i>Latin</i>, was owing to the Change of their
Languages. The true Reason was, they did not know how to hit the Point
of Solidity and Perfection in those Languages, which is necessary to
make a Work last, and set a Value upon it for ever. In effect, the
<i>Latin</i> Tongue, as it was written by <i>Cicero</i> and
<i>Virgil</i>, was very much chang’d in <i>Quintilian</i><span class =
"correction">’s</span> Time, and still more in the Time of <i>Aulus
Gellus</i>. However <i>Cicero</i> and <i>Virgil</i> were then more
esteem’d than even in their own Time, because they attain’d the height
of Perfection, of which I have spoken. It is not therefore on account of
the antiquated Words and Expressions in <i>Ronsard</i>, that
<i>Ronsard</i> has lost the Reputation he once had, but because the
Beauties which were thought to be in him, appear’d all at once to be no
Beauties at all.</p>

<p>Thus we see, that in order to bring us to the degree of Perfection
with which the Doctor flatters us by means of his new Academy, they must
teach us first to think justly, to distinguish false Beauty from true,
and glaring from Brightness, to banish those that write by Humour, and
receive only such as aim at Solidity in their Writings. How the
Celebrated <i>Tale</i> of a Tub will come off then with the best Judges,
I&nbsp;can easily guess, that excellent Treatise being much of the same
nature as <i>Rabelais</i>, of whom <i>La Bruyere</i> says,
<i><em>Rabelais</em> is incomprehensible: His Book is an inexplicable
Enigma,
<span class = "pagenum">29</span>
a meer Chimera; It has a Woman’s Face, with the Feet and Tail of a
Serpent, or some Beast more deform’d. ’Tis a Monstrous Collection of
Political and Ingenious Morality, with a Mixture of Beastliness; where
<span class = "correction">’tis</span> bad ’tis abominable, and fit for
the Diversion of the Rabble, and where ’tis good ’tis exquisite, and may
entertain the most delicate.</i></p>

<p>People very often apply those Faults to the Expression and Words
which are originally in the thought. The Merit of such as write by
Humour, Changes with the Mode, and their Language savouring of their
Sentiments, must of course grow out of Fashion. <i>Ronsard</i> the
<i>French</i> Poet was so far from writing ill <i>French</i>, that
<i>Pasquier</i> thought the <i>French</i> Tongue in its Perfection in
his Writings and yet upon the Appearance of <i>Malherb</i> and
<i>Bacan</i>, he was no more read nor talk’d of; Whereas there were
Authors before him, whose Writings are now in general Esteem, as
<i>Marot</i> and St. <i>Galais</i>, for the kind of Poetry in which they
excell’d, and their Stile is imitated for its Simplicity, by which <i>la
Fountain</i> acquir’d his Fame.</p>

<p>Instances of this kind may be given in our own Tongue, which has
improv’d in Refinement as much as the <i>French</i>. Our
<i>Shakespear</i> shone on the Stage, with all the Qualities of a
Dramatick Poet, and <i>Diction</i> in particular, when <ins class =
"correction" title = "text reads ‘the the’">the</ins> <i>French</i>
Stage was Barbarous. His Style has its Beauties now, and is newer than
many who have since Writ, and for a while with Reputation.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">30</span>
<p>Among all the various ways in which we of late have endeavour’d to
endear our selves to the <i>French</i>, and make ’em forgive us for
beating them so, nothing certainly will oblige ’em more than our
affecting to imitate them in our Political Style. Of this Nature is that
Novelty the Reverend Author has introduc’d into our Language, where the
Term <i>Prime Minister</i> has no more a Place than <i>Will and
Pleasure</i>. Pray who among the many Ministers Her Majesty is so
happily serv’d by, does she Honour with that Name, and how comes it that
<i>Prime</i> does not go with Precedence? What Law of ours Impowers any
body to order our Language to be <i>Inspected</i>, and who is there that
wou’d think himself oblig’d to obey him in it? Is there no difference
between the Ministers of a Despotick Monarchy, and the Servants of a
limited one, who have no Rule but the Law, and are as accountable to it
as the vilest of their Flatterers. We see how our Tongue would be
improv’d and enlarg’d, had the Doctor and his Brethren the ordering of
it. He has already impos’d on us the Court Style of <i>France</i>, and
their Politicks wou’d soon come after it. He pastes a particular
Compliment on our Tongue and his Patron, that they have not Merit enough
to subsist a Hundred Years without mending. As bad as our <i>English</i>
is, I’ll engage it will subsist in the History of another great Man of
this Nation, as long as the Names of <i>Edward</i> the III. or
<i>Henry</i> V. shall be remembred
<span class = "pagenum">31</span>
in <i>Britain</i>. There being some Characters so illustrious that
without the Ornaments of Stile or the Beauties of Wit, they Shine in
their Native Dress, and make every thing look Glorious about them.
Others there are which require all the Advantages of Language and
Invention, and darken every Thing that comes near them. The best of it
is, the Contempt with which he treats the <i>English</i> Tongue, is not
like to do it any harm, for whatever becomes of any ones History a
Hundred Years hence, the Doctor’s will certainly be of much shorter
Date, unless his Censurers should preserve the Memory of him, or he
thinks fit to own at last some other of his Productions, when ’tis
probable Fortune has done her best or her worst for him.</p>

<p>I have several very good Reasons why, if I were to be of this
Academy, I&nbsp;would banish the word Dozen out of our Dictionary, and
the Doctor has no doubt his to be fond of it, and fixing it there for
ever. The <i>French</i> King says <i>he has given about half a dozen
Pensions to Learned Men in several Parts of <em>Europe</em>, and perhaps
a dozen in his own Kingdom</i>; which, he said, purely out of Affection
to the Word Dozen, because he knew full well the <i>French</i> King
bestows Pensions on a Hundred Men in several Parts of <i>Europe</i>; and
on a Thousand in his own Kingdom, who excel in Arts and Literature,
<i>which, including the whole, do not amount to half the Income of many
a Private Commoner in <em>England</em></i>. Whereas I will engage to
<span class = "pagenum">32</span>
name Him a Hundred Pensions in <i>France</i> that have been given to Men
of Letters, every one of which shall amount to more than half the Income
of a dozen Lords, let me have the naming of them too. The History of his
Reign, which has been so long Writing, has cost him near threescore
Thousand Pounds Sterling. <i>Boileau</i> himself, after he had liv’d a
Life of Affluence and Pleasure, keeping a Country-House and City-House,
dy’d worth above Five or Six Thousand Pounds, which he had wholly from
the King. Not to mention the Rewards <i>Racine</i>, <i>Valincourt</i>,
and other Poets and Historians had, who were imployed about his History;
Nor those to all Academies of Sciences founded by him, and the great
Pensions he allow’d the Professors. The prodigious Expences he has been
at in Printing only at the <i>Louvre</i>, would perhaps amount to a Sum
equal to the whole Income of several Dozens that might be thought of
above the Rank of Commoners.</p>

<p><span class = "firstletter">S</span>UCH is our Case at present, that
if we have a Mind to be agreeably entertain’d with the State of our own
Affairs, we must look into Foreign Papers, rather than into those that
are publish’d here by Authority; and therefore I often read the
<i>Dutch</i> Prints with the same Eagerness and Pleasure, as the
<i>French</i> at <i>Paris</i> read the <i>Post Boy</i>. If we have no
good News for Our selves here, we may sometimes find some from
<i>Holland</i>; and what is good, is so rare, that I had rather have it

There has been lately form’d here <i>a Society to Reward and Encourage
Merit, with respect to the Liberal Arts and Sciences</i>. It is to be
composed of 21 Members, of which Number there are already 19 chosen:
That is to say, The Dukes of <i>Beaufort</i> and <i>Ormond</i>; the
Earls of <i>Arran</i> and <i>Orrory</i>; the Lords <i>Duplin</i>,
Son-in-Law of the Great Treasurer; <i>Harley</i>, Son of the said
Treasurer; <i>Lansdown</i>, Secretary of War; <i>Masham</i> and
<i>Bathurst</i>; Sir <i>W. Windham</i>; Mr. <i>St. John</i>, Secretary
of State; <i>Harcourt</i>, Son of the Lord Keeper; and <i>Raymond</i>,
Sollicitor-General: The Colonels <i>Hill</i> and <i>Desney</i>;
<i>Swift</i>, Doctor of Divinity; <i>Prior</i>, <i>Arbuthnott</i> the
Queen’s Physician; and <i>Friend</i>, Physician to the Duke of
<i>Ormond</i>. These Gentlemen who have deferr’d naming the other Two
Members till such time as they think fit, do now assemble every
<i>Thursday</i>, and have already given Rewards to some Authors, whose
Works have been approved of, and have recommended Others to the
Ministers of State, that they may have some Establishment.</p>

<span class = "pagenum">4</span>
<p>This Fact being thus fairly related, the Reader is desired to
observe, That it was in the Year 1629, under the single Ministry of
Cardinal <i>Richlieu</i>, when a Society of such great Wits was first
form’d at <i>Paris</i>; which was soon after establish’d, by an Edict of
the King, with the Style and Title of the <i>French</i> Academy. And it
is left to be determin’d by all Judicious Readers, whether this
<i>British</i> Seminary of Wit and Learning is not a Copy of that
Renown’d Society in <i>France</i>; and whether the Design and Model of
it has not been approved of there, since our happy Correspondence with
that Ingenious Nation.</p>

<p>The <i>French</i> Society consisted only at their first Meeting, of
Seven or Eight Men of Letters, who met together to talk about their
Books and Writings: And it was some time before Monsieur <i>Servien</i>,
Secretary of State, and other Persons, distinguish’d by their Condition,
as well as by their Merit, were added to the Company. But here we see
the <i>British</i> Society, at the very first Formation of it, is
compos’d of no less than Two Dukes, not only capable of
<i>Rewarding</i>, but of Judging, as well as of Writing: And likewise of
<span class = "pagenum">5</span>
<span class = "folionum">A4</span>
Two Earls; Five Lords; One Knight; One Secretary of State; Two Colonels
of Foot, and One Squire: Not to mention the Lawyer; the Doctors; the
Religious Priest; and the Poet. What therefore may we not expect from
the future Progress of this Society, which sets out with so much greater
Lustre, than that of its Original at <i>Paris</i>; so famous now all
over <i>Europe</i>.</p>

<p>The Great End and Business of the <i>French</i> Academy, was to
correct and refine their Language, as may be seen at large in the
History of that Academy, written by Monsieur <i>Pelisson</i>: And we
have already a Proposal, publish’d the 17th of <i>May</i> 1712, <i>for
Correcting, Improving, and Ascertaining the <em>English</em> Tongue, in
a Letter to the most Honourable <em>Robert</em> Earl of <em>Oxford</em>
and <em>Mortimer</em>, Lord High Treasurer of <em>Great Britain</em>: By
<em>Jonathan Swift</em>, D.D.</i></p>


<p class = "space">
<i>Louis</i>, King of France, by Letters Patents, in the Year 1635,
having mention’d the Great Things done for the Glory and Embellishment
of <i>France</i>, by his dearly belov’d Cousin the Cardinal
<i>Richlieu</i>, His Principal Minister of State, gives that Minister
Power and Authority to call himself the Chief, and the Protector of the
<i>French</i>
<span class = "pagenum">6</span>
Academy: And doubtless the Scheme of this <i>British</i> Academy is
form’d with a View no less Glorious; That the Great and Memorable
Actions of this <i>Minister</i>; the mighty Things perfom’d for the
Allies and the Common Cause; the vast Successes against the Enemy; and,
above all, the Restoring of Credit, and Paying the Publick Debts, may be
fairly transmitted to Posterity.</p>

<p>That this is the chief Design of our <i>new Erected Society</i>, is
plainly insinuated by the Author of the Letter before mentioned; for
which the Reader may please to see his own Words: <i>If Things go
on</i>, says he, <i>at the present Rate</i>, (that is, if our Language
be not corrected, improved, and ascertain’d,) <i>all I can promise your
Lordship, is, That about Two hundred Years hence some painful Compiler,
who will be at the Trouble of studying old Language, may inform the
World, that in the Reign of <em><span class = "sans">Queen</span>
ANNE</em>, <em>ROBERT <span class = "sans">Earl of</span> OXFORD, <span
class = "sans">a&nbsp;very Wise and Excellent Man</span></em>, was made
<em>High Treasurer</em>, and saved his Countrey.</i> [Mark those last
Words, pray, as you go along.] <i>Thus much he may be able to pick out,
and willing to transfer into his New History; but the rest of your
Character which I, or any other Writer, may value our
<span class = "pagenum">7</span>
selves by drawing: And the Particular Account of the <em><span class =
"sans">great</span></em> Things, done under your Ministry, for which you
are already so Celebrated in <em>most</em> Parts of <em>Europe</em>,
will probably be dropt.</i> So far that Author: But I cannot help
differing with him in one Particular: For I am firmly of Opinion, that
altho our Language should happen not to be <i>improved</i> or
<i>ascertain’d</i>, yet the <i>great Things</i> done by that <i>very
Wise and Excellent Man</i>, will not so easily be forgotten; nor the
<i>rest</i> of his Character be <i>dropt</i>, for which he is already
<i>so celebrated in most Parts of <em>Europe</em></i>.</p>

<p>Besides, as there seems to be an Exact Agreement between the intended
Protector of this Society, and that of the <i>French</i> Academy in its
Infancy, there can be no Doubt but the great Work will be carried on
after much the same Manner, and under the same Statutes and Regulations.
And it appears in Monsieur <i>Pelisson</i>’s History of the
<i>French</i> Academy, That every Member of it, both Present and Future,
Friend or Foe, was oblig’d in Gratitude to their Protector, to <i>revere
his Virtue and his Memory</i>. The <i>British</i> Academicians being
therefore under the same Obligation, how is it possible that their
<i>Protector</i>’s <i>Vertue</i> or <i>Memory</i> should ever be
forgotten?</p>

<span class = "pagenum">8</span>
<p>And there is one considerable Advantage, which our New Academy will
have above the <i>French</i>. For it appears by the History just
mention’d, that after the <i>French</i> King had given his Consent, that
his dear Cousin should be Chief of the Academy, the Parliament could not
for a long while be brought to confirm the Patent. And Monsieur
<i>Pelisson</i> gives the Reasons of it. <i>Cardinal
<em>Richlieu</em></i>, says he, <i>having carried the <em>Royal
Authority</em> a great deal higher than any one had done before him; tho
belov’d by some, was envy’d by others, hated and detested by many,
fear’d and dreaded by all. His Creatures</i>, continues he, <i>talk’d of
this Design with excessive Encomiums. Never</i>, said they, <i>were the
past Ages possest of so much Eloquence as ours is like to be. We shall
out-do all that went before us, and all that shall come after. And the
greatest Share of the Glory will redound to the Academy and the
Cardinal. Others, on the contrary, treated this Design as ridiculous.
They accused the Academy as aiming to give Laws to Things not
susceptible of them, and were perpetually falling upon them with Jests
and Satyrs. Distrustful People could not tell but there might be a Snake
in the Grass; and were afraid the establishing this Society would be a
new Support of his Domination, that they were only
<span class = "pagenum">9</span>
his Pensioners, maintain’d by him to justify all his Actions, and make
Observations on those of others.</i> These were the Difficulties in
France: But our New Society need fear no such Opposition as the
<i>Frenchmen</i> found from their Parliament of <i>Paris</i>. Our
<i>Parl<span class = "dash">&mdash;&mdash;</span>t</i> will most
certainly be as forward to pass an Act in Favour of them and their
Protector, as they have been to do so many great Things already for him
and the Nation, and even to pass a Vote in his Praise. Besides, there is
no Body can pretend that <i>he has ever carried the Royal Authority
higher than any one had done before him</i>; nor can it be imagin’d that
he has a thousandth Part of the Enemies that Cardinal <i>Richlieu</i>
had: And I am fully persuaded, that all Things being consider’d, both at
Home and Abroad, there is not a Man in the World that <i>envies</i> him.
And tho he has been suspected to <i>maintain Pensioners to justify his
own Actions, and make Observations on those of others</i>; yet, whoever
will look carefully over the List of the Members, must needs acquit him
of that Calumny, and confess, that he who pick’d out such a Set of
<i>Wits</i> and <i>Patrons</i>, could have no such base Thoughts in his
Head.</p>

<p>When the <i>French</i> Academy had settled their Statutes, the next
Thing they did
<span class = "pagenum">10</span>
was to get a Seal. And what was the Impression? Why, only their
Protectors Picture; not engrav’d like a <i>Seneca</i>’s Head, but drawn
at length with a modest Word on the Reverse. <i>To Immortality.</i>
Something like this may be very easily done here. But I am not for
putting on the Reverse, <i>the Bill for the Protestant Succession</i>;
tho it may be seen in the Protector’s Hand at Sir
<i>G.&nbsp;Kneller</i>’s: For that is too gross, even for a common
Picture. But what think you of his own Head on one Side and Twelve Lords
on the Reverse? Or since all other Societies have taken their
<i>Motto’s</i> from the Old World, suppose he fetch’d one from the New;
and clapp’d his own Face upon the Frontispiece, with this Word on the
Reverse, written in Cyphers, <span class = "extended"><i>THE
SOUTH-SEA</i></span>.</p>

<p>I have but one or two Objections to the Statutes in <i>France</i>,
which I cannot get over. One is, they must not meddle with Matters of
Religion. This might have very ill Consequences, and hinder their Top
Wit from shewing his Talents: I&nbsp;mean that Orthodox Divine, who it
is well known was never half so witty upon any other Subject, as upon
that of Religion. Another Law of theirs that gives me Offence, is, The
Law by which they are oblig’d
<span class = "pagenum">11</span>
to judge of no-body’s Works but their own. For perhaps our Academy may
not be in a Humour to write any Thing these Hundred Years, except a
Trifle now and then, as an <i>Examiner</i>, a&nbsp;<i>Conduct</i>,
a&nbsp;<i>John Bull</i>, or so. All which Works are allowable, because
the <i>French</i> Statute says, <i>Political Matters may be treated of
conformably to the Authority of the State</i>.</p>

<p>There was one Rule more among the <i>French</i> Academicians, that
will never do in <i>England</i> which is their forbidding the Academy’s
Certificate to be printed before the Writings of the Members, and
allowing ’em only to put, <i>Par un tel de l’Academie Francoise</i>; As
if one should say, <i>By such a Person of the <em>British</em>
Academy</i>. This would make mad Work here: Every little
<i>Grubstreet</i> Scribler would presently be publishing his Trash, with
the stolen Title of <i>My Lord such a one, or Brigadier such a one, of
the <em>British</em> Academy.</i> And how should we be able to
distinguish the Right from the Wrong, unless their License be printed
before in Form, like a Privilege Royal, <i>To our Trusty and
Well-beloved <em>Abel Roper</em>, of <em>London</em>,
Bookseller</i>.</p>

<p>Having just mention’d <i>Abel</i>, it puts me in Mind of a certain
Officer belonging to the <i>French</i> Academy, call’d
<span class = "pagenum">12</span>
a Library-Keeper. This was given to one <i>Camusat</i>, the most Eminent
Bookseller then in <i>Paris</i>: And I presume no body will say that
Trusty <i>Abel</i> is not the fittest Man in <i>England</i> for that
Office: He being supposed not only to have printed, but even to have
father’d some considerable Works of the most Elegant of all our
Academicians.</p>

<p>There’s nothing else very remarkable in the Laws of the <i>French
Academy</i>, except their forbidding any Member to write in their
Defence, which it is probable will be thought worth observing here. For
if our Society should pretend to answer every impertinent Thing that
will be written against them, they would be finely set to Work. If
therefore they should happen to be daily pelted at, the shortest way
will be to despise their Opponents, and to consider themselves as
Persons above the Reach of Malice; incorporated under a glorious
Protector for some good End or other; and in daily Expectation of having
a Charter and an Act of Parliament to back them; and of being made Wits
by the Laws of the Land.</p>

<p>I cannot conclude without observing how pat every Thing happens: The
<i>French</i> Society met on <i>Thursdays</i>. So the News
<span class = "pagenum">13</span>
tells us, the <i>English</i> do; with this good difference: The
<i>French</i> met after they had din’d. The <i>English</i>, they say,
dine together, and drink a chearful Glass afterwards; which has great
Efficacy in Matters of Wit and Eloquence, as well for those that are to
<i>write</i>, as those that are to <i>reward</i>. Wine is therefore
call’d <i>Generous</i>, and is as nearly ally’d to Wit, as Wit is to
Madness. How much wittier are some Men over the third Bottle than over
the first! A&nbsp;strong Reason that the Meeting should be at a Tavern,
and not any private House, which the <i>French</i> Academy found very
inconvenient; for whenever the Members, at whose Houses they met, took a
Fancy to Marry, their Wives turn’d the Wits out of Doors; as it happen’d
in the Case of Monsieur <i>Conrart</i> and some others. Thus they were
driven from one place to another, till their Protector got them a Room
in the King’s own Palace; which cannot conveniently be done in
<i>England</i> whilst Lodgings are so scarce: And therefore I hope they
will drink on as they do, till <i>Whitehall</i> is rebuilt. And here I
will leave them for the present: When their two other Members are
chosen, it may perhaps be not unseasonable to acquaint the Publick with
the
<span class = "pagenum">14</span>
further Progress of this hopeful Society; and to shew all the World how
far we not only imitate or copy, but even excel our Friends the
<i>French</i>. In the mean time, I&nbsp;hope, some of their best Writers
will be order’d to give us a short Touch or Essay of their Eloquence,
upon <i>our late Glorious Enterprize against the <em>French</em>, on
<em>Tuesday</em> the 20th of this present <em>May</em>, under the
Command of his Grace the D. of <em>Orm&mdash;d</em>.</i></p>

<p>Except for clear typographical errors, the French text was left
unchanged because it is impossible to know where the errors originated.
All accents are as printed.</p>

<div class = "hanging">
<p><b>les Comites</b>: Modern form is <i>Comtes</i>.</p>
<p><b>les Chevalier Windham </b>: Error for <i>le</i> Chevalier ...</p>
<p><b>Fils du Garde des Seaux</b>: Possible error for Sceaux. In modern
French, <i>seau</i> is a coal scuttle while <i>sceau</i> is a seal
(here, Lord Keeper of the Seal).</p>
<p><b>Swif</b>: Error for Swift.</p>
<p><b>Prior Arbuthnott</b>: Missing punctuation such as , or ; between
names.</p>
<p><b>Medicin du Duc</b>: Spelling <i>Medicin</i> unchanged.</p>
<p><b>les Deux autre</b>: Error for <i>autres</i>.</p>
